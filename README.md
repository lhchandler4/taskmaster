## How to use the Lambda function


## Issues with Lambda deployment
- Encountered a lot of issues. The first was with IAM user permissions.
Solved that problem and then there were many issues with my actual lambda function.
This was probably due to the fact that I was modifying the lambda resizing function
from https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/with-s3-example.html.
